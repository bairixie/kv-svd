# TL;DR

Replacing FP32 Householder QR with 16-bit matrix multiplications and Cholesky QR in randomized SVD achieves a **4.1× speedup** over `torch.svd_lowrank` for online KV-Cache compression, with negligible accuracy loss on the RULER benchmark.

# 1. Introduction

Large Language Models are increasingly deployed at long context lengths — hundreds of thousands of tokens — creating a severe memory bottleneck. During autoregressive generation, the attention mechanism caches every previously computed Key and Value (KV) state. This **KV-Cache** grows as $\mathcal{O}(L \cdot d \cdot N_\text{layers})$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ the per-head hidden dimension. For a 32-layer model with head dimension 512 at 128k-token context in 16-bit precision, the KV-Cache alone requires tens of gigabytes — often comparable to the model weights themselves.

SVD-based compression addresses this directly. Recent work, **xKV** [5], observes that the dominant singular vectors of KV-Caches are well-aligned *across* adjacent layers. Concatenating the KV-Caches of $G$ adjacent layers and applying one shared SVD extracts a basis common to all of them — achieving up to **8× higher compression** while maintaining accuracy. However, that memory saving comes at a cost: xKV must compute SVD **online** during the prefill phase of every request, and this step becomes a significant and growing fraction of prefill latency.

In this blog post we will walk through:
1. How SVD compresses matrices in general.
2. How xKV applies SVD to the KV-Cache.
3. Why existing PyTorch SVD implementations — both full and randomized — remain a bottleneck online.

Then we present two targeted optimizations to randomized SVD — 16-bit matrix multiplications for the power iteration (unlocking Tensor Cores) and a numerically robust Cholesky QR for orthogonalization — that together deliver a **4.1× speedup** over `torch.svd_lowrank` with negligible accuracy loss on RULER.

Our implementation is publicly available at [github.com/bairixie/kv-svd](https://github.com/bairixie/kv-svd), evaluated within the [xKV framework](https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV) on an NVIDIA RTX A6000.

# 2. Background

## 2.1 Singular Value Decomposition

For any real matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, the **Singular Value Decomposition** (SVD) is [7]:

$$X = U \Sigma V^\top$$

where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ are orthogonal matrices, and $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is diagonal with non-negative entries $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_r \geq 0$, $r = \min(m, n)$.

Truncating to the top-$k$ components gives the **rank-$k$ approximation** $X_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^\top$. The **Eckart-Young theorem** guarantees it is optimal:

$$\|X - X_k\|_F = \min_{\text{rank}(Y) \leq k} \|X - Y\|_F = \sqrt{\sigma_{k+1}^2 + \sigma_{k+2}^2 + \cdots}$$

No other rank-$k$ matrix achieves smaller error — this is the theoretical foundation for SVD-based compression throughout machine learning.

## 2.2 SVD for Matrix Compression

Taking the three truncated matrices ($U_k, \Sigma_k, V_k^\top$) after applying SVD, we can absorb the $\Sigma_k$ into either $U_k$ or $V_k^\top$ to derive:
+ $A = U_k  \Sigma_k \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$
+ $B = V_k^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times n}$ 

We term $A$ as the basis, and $B$ as the reconstruction matrix. Looking carefully at the shape of the matrices, performing a rank-$k$ SVD on a matrix $X$ can yield a compressed representation of space complexity $\mathcal{O}(mk+nk)$. When $k$ is sufficiently small, we successfully yield a more compact representation for the original matrix $X$ using a pair of smaller matrices.

# 3. SVD for KV-Cache Compression

## 3.1 Review of xKV
Now that we understand how SVD can compress generic tensors, we turn to how it applies to the KV-Cache, which can itself be viewed as a matrix.

Concretely, at prefill we have per-layer KV-Caches $X_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$, with sequence length $L$ and per-head dimension $d$. Rather than treat each layer in isolation, we concatenate the caches of $G$ adjacent layers into a single tall matrix

$$
\mathbf{X} \;=\; \bigl[X_{\ell_1}, \ldots, X_{\ell_G}\bigr] \;\in\; \mathbb{R}^{L \times (Gd)}.
$$

Following the basis/reconstruction decomposition from [Section 2.2](#22-svd-for-matrix-compression), a rank-$k$ SVD of $\mathbf{X}$ — with the reconstruction matrix split column-wise by layer — yields a shared basis $A$ alongside $G$ layer-specific reconstruction slices $B_{\ell_i}$:

$$
\mathbf{X} \;\approx\; A\,\bigl[B_{\ell_1}, \ldots, B_{\ell_G}\bigr], \qquad A \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times k},\;\; B_{\ell_i} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}.
$$

Each layer's cache is recovered by $X_{\ell_i} \approx A\,B_{\ell_i}$, so one SVD compresses all $G$ layers jointly with total storage $\mathcal{O}(Lk + Gdk)$ in place of $\mathcal{O}(GLd)$. The per-layer baseline is simply $G = 1$; there is no fundamental split between "single-layer" and "cross-layer" SVD, only a choice of $G$.

In xKV, SVD is performed **online** after prefill to better capture the changing dynamics of the inputs for accuracy preservation. While applying SVD to the KV-Cache effectively reduces its size, it is not a free lunch: on an RTX A6000, PyTorch's `torch.linalg.svd` (full SVD) alone accounts for **73.4%** of per-sample profiling time — not viable for production.

# 4. Toward Efficient SVD Computation — Randomized SVD

## 4.1 Compute Only the Needed Singular Vectors

For KV-Cache compression we only need the top-$k$ singular vectors. Full SVD computes all $\min(m, n)$ components — often $10\times$ to $100\times$ more than necessary. One direct intuition for optimizing SVD is therefore to compute only the singular vectors we actually need, which is exactly what Randomized SVD does.

Randomized SVD [1] reduces the dominant cost from $\mathcal{O}(mn^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mnk)$ by identifying the $k$-dimensional dominant subspace directly. We benchmark PyTorch's off-the-shelf `torch.svd_lowrank` and observe SVD's share of per-sample profiling time drop from 73.4% to **13.0%**.

## 4.2 Algorithm Behind Randomized SVD

The algorithm proceeds in four stages.

**Stage 1 — Setup.** Transpose if $m < n$ so all stages operate on a tall matrix. Resolve working dtype; allocate $\mathbf{I}_{k+p}$.

```python
if m < n:  A, M = A.T, M.T
X    = cast(A, working_dtype)
eye_q = identity(k + p, dtype=working_dtype)
```

**Stage 2 — Random Projection.** Draw $R \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (k+p)}$ and form sketch $Y = (A - M)R$. Orthonormalize to initial basis $Q$.

```python
R = randn(n, k + p, dtype=working_dtype)
Y = (A - M) @ R
Q = orthonormalize(Y)
```

**Stage 3 — Power Iteration.** Alternate $A^\top$ and $A$ to sharpen $Q$:

```python
for _ in range(n_iter):
    Q = orthonormalize((A - M).T @ Q)
    Q = orthonormalize((A - M)  @ Q)
```

Each iteration amplifies eigenvalue ratios by $(\sigma_i / \sigma_j)^{2n_\text{iter}}$, rapidly concentrating $Q$ on the dominant subspace. With $n_\text{iter} = 4$, this stage accounts for **62–80%** of total SVD time depending on implementation.

**Stage 4 — Project and Recover.**

```python
B       = Q.T @ (A - M)                    # shape: (k+p) × n
U_, S, Vt = svd(B.float(), full=False)     # FP32: torch.linalg.svd rejects 16-bit input
U       = Q @ U_
# truncate to top-k; undo transpose if needed
```

Total cost is dominated by the $(2n_\text{iter} + 1)$ multiplications with $A$, each $\mathcal{O}(mn(k+p))$ — a factor of $n/(k+p)$ cheaper than full SVD.

## 4.3 Limitations of the Existing Implementation (`torch.svd_lowrank`)

**1. FP32 throughout — no Tensor Core utilization.** All matrix multiplications in Stages 1–3 run in FP32. Modern NVIDIA GPUs (Ampere, Hopper) deliver substantially higher throughput for 16-bit operations via Tensor Cores. In our profiling, the matrix-multiply sub-cost of the power iteration alone is **91.5 s**.

**2. Householder QR is the orthogonalization bottleneck.** Each `orthonormalize(·)` call invokes `torch.linalg.qr`. While backward-stable, Householder QR's sequential panel factorizations expose limited parallelism for tall-and-skinny shapes ($m \gg k+p$). The QR sub-cost in the power iteration is **222.6 s** — 56.9% of the total 392.0 s wall-clock time in randomized SVD.

# 5. Hardware-Efficient Randomized SVD (Our Method)

## 5.1 Overview

Our method is structurally identical to `torch.svd_lowrank`. We introduce exactly two modifications: (1) **16-bit computation** for all large matrix operations, and (2) **Cholesky QR** for orthogonalization. The design principle is to maximize 16-bit coverage for bandwidth-bound operations while performing a surgical FP32 upgrade only where precision is non-negotiable.

| Stage | Operation | `torch.svd_lowrank` | Ours (16-bit path) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1. Setup | Cast input, $\mathbf{I}_{k+p}$ | FP32 | **16-bit** |
| 2. Random Projection | $Y = AR$, orthogonalize | FP32 · Householder QR | **16-bit matmul · Cholesky QR** |
| 3. Power Iteration | $A^\top Q$, $AQ$, orth. | FP32 · Householder QR | **16-bit matmuls · Cholesky QR** |
| 4a. Projection | $B = Q^\top(A{-}M)$ | FP32 | **16-bit** |
| **4b. Small SVD** | $\text{svd}(B)$ | FP32 | **FP32** (PyTorch constraint) |
| 4c. Lift & truncate | $U = Q\hat{U}$ | FP32 | **16-bit** |

Two design choices deserve emphasis. `chol_qr` is **16-bit-in / 16-bit-out** with an internal FP32 upgrade: it receives a 16-bit matrix, immediately upcasts to FP32 for Gram matrix computation and Cholesky factorization (where numerical stability matters), then returns $Q$ in 16-bit. Inter-stage memory traffic stays in 16-bit; the factorization runs in FP32.

Stage 4b **must** remain FP32 because `torch.linalg.svd` raises a runtime error on 16-bit input — a hard PyTorch constraint, not a precision choice. Fortunately $B$ has shape $(k+p) \times n$ (e.g., $4 \times 512$ with $p = 0$), making this cost negligible.

## 5.2 Optimization 1: 16-bit Power Iteration

The power iteration consists of repeated large matrix multiplications:

$$Q \;\leftarrow\; \text{orth}(A^\top Q), \qquad Q \;\leftarrow\; \text{orth}(A\,Q)$$

where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times (Gd)}$ is the grouped KV-Cache. Three properties make this ideal for precision reduction:

* **Memory-bandwidth bound.** The dominant cost is reading $A$ from GPU HBM. Reducing element size from 32-bit to 16-bit directly halves memory traffic.

* **Approximation-tolerant.** The power iteration estimates a subspace, not an exact result. 16-bit rounding errors are equivalent to a small perturbation of the input — precisely the regime that randomized SVD handles robustly [1]. Subsequent iterations further suppress single-step errors.

* **Not the final computation.** Stage 3 produces only an intermediate orthonormal basis $Q$. Singular values are computed in Stage 4b in FP32.

On RTX A6000, switching from FP32 to 16-bit reduces the matrix-multiply sub-cost from **91.5 s → 22.5 s (4.1×)**, consistent with expected gains from Tensor Core utilization and halved memory bandwidth. Our implementation supports both IEEE float16 and bfloat16; both yield essentially identical task accuracy and performance on these workloads.

## 5.3 Optimization 2: Numerically Robust Cholesky QR

Each `orthonormalize(Y)` call takes $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times (k+p)}$ with $m \gg k+p$. All internal computation is FP32; the result is cast back to 16-bit on return.

### Basic Cholesky QR

Cholesky QR [2] exploits the algebraic identity: if $Y = QR$ then $Y^\top Y = R^\top R$. In other words, the $R$ factor we want is simultaneously the Cholesky factor of the small Gram matrix $G = Y^\top Y$. This turns orthogonalization into three BLAS calls: one SYRK to form $G$, one Cholesky on the tiny $(k+p)\times(k+p)$ matrix, and one triangular solve (TRSM) to recover $Q = Y R^{-1}$.

Compared to Householder QR, Cholesky QR requires roughly **half the total flop count** for tall-skinny matrices [2]. SYRK and TRSM are Level-3 BLAS routines achieving near-peak GPU throughput; Householder QR's sequential panel updates expose far less parallelism for small $k+p$.

### Gram Matrix Symmetrization

Before factorizing, we explicitly symmetrize $G$:

$$G \;\leftarrow\; 0.5\,(G + G^\top)$$

Floating-point rounding in $Y^\top Y$ accumulates small off-diagonal asymmetries. Explicit symmetrization eliminates this drift before it reaches `cholesky_ex`, reducing spurious factorization failures.

### Adaptive Shift Regularization

Following the shifted Cholesky QR framework of Fukaya et al. [3], we add a scale-invariant diagonal regularization:

$$G_\text{shifted} = G + \varepsilon \cdot \text{scale} \cdot I, \quad \text{scale} = \text{mean}(\text{diag}(G)).\text{clamp}(\min=10^{-12})$$

We drive this with `torch.linalg.cholesky_ex`, which returns an `info` tensor rather than raising an exception — making batch-aware failure detection easy. Starting from $\varepsilon_0 = 10^{-5}$, we try the shifted Cholesky; on any batch element's failure we multiply $\varepsilon$ by 10 (capped at `max_eps`) and retry, up to `max_tries` attempts. In the common case — a well-conditioned $Y$ — the first attempt succeeds and the shift is numerically negligible; the exponential backoff only kicks in for progressively more ill-conditioned inputs, with no manual tuning required.

### Eigh SPD-Repair Fallback

If all shifted Cholesky attempts fail, we don't give up — instead we reconstruct a strictly positive definite approximation of $G$ and Cholesky-factorize that [4]. Concretely: eigendecompose $G = V\Lambda V^\top$, clamp the eigenvalues to be at least $\max(10^{-4}, \varepsilon)$, reassemble $G_\text{spd} = V\bar{\Lambda} V^\top$, and Cholesky-factor that instead.

This reconstruct-then-Cholesky design keeps the downstream triangular solve well-conditioned: $R$'s diagonal entries are bounded away from zero by construction, so we never amplify the clamped eigenvalue errors.

### Householder QR as Final Safety Net

If even the eigh path raises an exception, we fall back to standard Householder QR via `torch.linalg.qr(Y, mode="reduced")`. This recovers exactly the behavior of `torch.svd_lowrank`, making our implementation **strictly more robust than the baseline** — it can never perform worse. In practice, this path is almost never triggered; it exists purely as a correctness guarantee.

### Putting It All Together

Putting the four pieces into one routine gives the complete `chol_qr` we use in Stages 2 and 3. It's 16-bit-in / 16-bit-out, with the internal factorization lifted to FP32 for stability:

```python
@torch.no_grad()
def chol_qr(
    Y_fp16: Tensor,
    eye: Tensor,
    base_eps: float = 1e-5,
    max_eps: float = 10.0,
    max_tries: int = 6,
    use_eigh_last: bool = True,
) -> Tensor:
    # Work in float32 internally for numerical stability.
    Y = Y_fp16.float()

    # Gram matrix G = Y^H Y, symmetrized to remove finite-precision drift.
    G = torch.matmul(Y.mH, Y)
    G = 0.5 * (G + G.mH)

    # Scale-invariant jitter derived from the mean of the diagonal.
    d = torch.diagonal(G, dim1=-2, dim2=-1)
    scale = d.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True).clamp_min_(1e-12).unsqueeze(-1)

    # Shifted Cholesky with exponential backoff on eps.
    eps = base_eps
    for _ in range(max_tries):
        R, info = torch.linalg.cholesky_ex(G + (eps * scale) * eye, upper=True)
        if (info == 0).all():
            Q = torch.linalg.solve_triangular(R, Y, upper=True, left=False)
            return Q.to(Y_fp16.dtype)
        eps = min(eps * 10.0, max_eps)

    # Fallback 1: eigh-based SPD repair, then Cholesky on the repaired matrix.
    if use_eigh_last:
        try:
            L, V = torch.linalg.eigh(G)
            L = torch.clamp(L, min=max(1e-4, eps))
            G_spd = torch.matmul(V, torch.matmul(torch.diag_embed(L), V.mH))
            R = torch.linalg.cholesky(G_spd, upper=True)
            Q = torch.linalg.solve_triangular(R, Y, upper=True, left=False)
            return Q.to(Y_fp16.dtype)
        except Exception:
            pass

    # Fallback 2: plain Householder QR — matches torch.svd_lowrank exactly.
    Q, _ = torch.linalg.qr(Y, mode="reduced")
    return Q.to(Y_fp16.dtype)
```

The structure mirrors the progression in this section: the fast happy path (shifted Cholesky) handles the overwhelming majority of inputs, and each fallback layer exists to absorb a progressively rarer failure mode without ever being slower than the baseline.

# 6. Experiments

## 6.1 Setup

**Hardware.** Single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. All timing figures report self CUDA time via the PyTorch profiler, collected during the profiling (prefill) phase only — steady-state decode-phase evaluation is left for future work.

**Benchmark.** We evaluate within the xKV framework [5] at [github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV](https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV). Accuracy is measured on four RULER subtasks [6]: *Frequent Word Extraction* (FWE), *NIAH MultiKey*, *NIAH Single1*, and *Variable Tracking* (VT). RULER is a long-context evaluation suite designed to stress KV-Cache compression artifacts by requiring retrieval and reasoning at various positions within a long context.

**Configuration.** Layer group size $G = 4$, $n_\text{iter} = 4$ power iteration steps, oversampling $p = 4$. Full SVD was profiled at approximately 10 samples due to OOM at 96 samples; other methods ran for 96 samples.

**Methods compared:**

* `torch.linalg.svd` — full SVD, FP32 (memory-limited reference only)
* `torch.svd_lowrank` — randomized SVD, FP32, Householder QR
* **Ours** — 16-bit · Cholesky-QR (this work)

## 6.2 End-to-End SVD Latency

<figure>
<img src="/imgs/blog/svd_blog/Figure_1_SVD_Time_Proportion.png" alt="SVD Overhead per Sample" width="700"/>
<figcaption>Fig. 1 — Per-sample CUDA time decomposed into SVD (dark) and other inference tasks (grey). Our method reduces SVD from 13.0% to 3.6% of total per-sample time.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Takeaways.**

* **Full SVD is not viable:** it consumes 73.4% of profiling time per sample and causes OOM at 96 samples.
* **`torch.svd_lowrank` is still a bottleneck:** 13.0% SVD overhead (4.1 s/sample) limits throughput.
* **Ours drops SVD to 3.6%:** per-sample SVD time falls from 4.1 s → 1.0 s (**4.1×**), a level where SVD is no longer a dominant cost.

| Method | Total / sample | SVD / sample | SVD % |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Full SVD (`torch.linalg.svd`, fp32) | 54.2 s | 39.8 s | 73.4% |
| `torch.svd_lowrank` (fp32 · Householder QR) | 31.5 s | 4.1 s | 13.0% |
| **Ours (16-bit · Cholesky-QR)** | 28.4 s | **1.0 s** | **3.6%** |

## 6.3 Stage-Level Breakdown

| Stage | fp32 · Householder QR | 16-bit · Cholesky-QR (ours) | Speedup |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| 1. Setup (dtype cast / alloc) | 0.017 s (0.0%) | 3.60 s (3.7%) | — |
| 2. Random Projection | 39.3 s (10.0%) | 10.8 s (11.2%) | <span style="color:#1a6a5a">3.6×</span> |
| 3. Power Iteration (×4) | 314.1 s (80.1%) | 60.3 s (62.4%) | <span style="color:#1a6a5a">5.2×</span> |
| — <span style="color:#4e79a7">Matrix Multiply</span> | 91.5 s | 22.5 s | <span style="color:#1a6a5a">4.1×</span> |
| — <span style="color:#c0373a">Orthogonalization</span> | 222.6 s | 37.8 s | <span style="color:#1a6a5a">5.9×</span> |
| 4. Project & Recover | 38.6 s (9.9%) | 21.9 s (22.7%) | <span style="color:#1a6a5a">1.8×</span> |
| **Total** | **392.0 s** | **96.7 s** | <span style="color:#c0373a">**4.1×**</span> |

**Takeaways.**

* **Stage 1** adds 3.60 s of one-time dtype cast overhead, fully amortized by Stage 3 savings.
* **Stage 3** is the primary bottleneck and primary gain. Power iteration drops from 314.1 s (80.1%) to 60.3 s (62.4%), a **5.2× speedup** from two independent sources: **matrix multiply** improves **4.1×** from Tensor Core utilization; **orthogonalization** improves **5.9×** from Cholesky QR replacing Householder QR — a particularly large gain because Householder QR's sequential panel structure is ill-suited to tall-and-skinny shapes with small $k+p$.
* **Stage 4** shows a modest **1.8× gain** from the 16-bit projection $B = Q^\top(A-M)$. Its share of total time grows from 9.9% to 22.7% — not because it became slower, but because Stage 3 shrank so dramatically.

## 6.4 Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-off

<figure>
<img src="/imgs/blog/svd_blog/Figure_2_SVD_Accuracy_Comparison_VT.png" alt="Accuracy Comparison" width="700"/>
<figcaption>Fig. 3 — Average accuracy over four RULER subtasks (FWE · NIAH MultiKey · NIAH Single1 · VT). RTX A6000 · n_iter=4 · G=4 · oversampling p=4.</figcaption>
</figure>

| Method | FWE | NIAH MultiKey | NIAH Single1 | VT | **Average** |
|--------|-----|---------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| Full SVD (`torch.linalg.svd`) | 74.0% | 58.3% | 97.9% | 41.5% | 67.92% |
| `torch.svd_lowrank` (baseline) | 75.0% | 55.2% | 99.0% | 39.8% | 67.24% |
| **Ours (16-bit · Cholesky-QR)** | **74.7%** | **58.3%** | **95.8%** | **40.6%** | **67.36%** |

**Takeaways.**

* Averaged over all four RULER subtasks, our method (**67.36%**) matches the `torch.svd_lowrank` baseline (67.24%) within **0.12 percentage points** — negligible accuracy cost for **4.1× lower SVD latency**.
* On two of four subtasks — NIAH MultiKey and VT — our method *outperforms* the baseline, reflecting that oversampling $p=4$ improves the quality of the random subspace estimate [1].
* A modest gap on NIAH Single1 (95.8% vs. 99.0%) likely reflects the slightly lower orthogonality of Cholesky QR for well-conditioned inputs [2] and minor 16-bit rounding in the power iteration.
